### INPUT SHAPING
#[include adxlmcu.cfg] # ONLY FOR USE DURING INPUT SHAPING TESTING - Leaving this on without the accelerometer plugged in will cause Klipper to not work.

retract_length: 0.5
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated,
#   and to unretract when G11 is activated (but see
#   unretract_extra_length below). The default is 0 mm.
retract_speed: 35
#   The speed of retraction, in mm/s. The default is 20 mm/s.
unretract_extra_length: 0
#   The length (in mm) of *additional* filament to add when
#   unretracting.
unretract_speed: 10
#   The speed of unretraction, in mm/s. The default is 10 mm/s.

## !!! Custom macros, please use with care and review the section of the corresponding macro.
## These macros are for simple operations like setting a status LED. Please make sure your macro does not interfere with the basic macro functions.
## Only  single line commands are supported, please create a macro if you need more than one command.
##variable_user_pause_macro : ""    # Everything inside the "" will be executed after the klipper base pause (PAUSE_BASE) function
#variable_user_resume_macro: ""    # Everything inside the "" will be executed before the klipper base resume (RESUME_BASE) function
#variable_user_cancel_macro: ""    # Everything inside the "" will be executed before the klipper base cancel (CANCEL_PRINT_BASE) function
